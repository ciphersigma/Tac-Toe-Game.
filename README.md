# Tac-Toe-Game

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game repository! This simple yet classic game is a demonstration of my coding skills and passion for interactive applications.

## About the Game

Tic Tac Toe, also known as "X and O" or "Noughts and Crosses," is a two-player game where the goal is to be the first to form a line of three symbols (either 'X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- Interactive web-based interface (or command-line interface, depending on the version).
- User-friendly gameplay instructions.
- A fun and challenging way to test your strategic thinking.
- A great opportunity for me to practice coding and game development.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and improve upon the game or add new features. I'd love to see your contributions and ideas!
